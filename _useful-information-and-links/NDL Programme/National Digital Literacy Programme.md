# **National Digital Literacy Programme**

### National Digital Literacy Programme

1.     At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. This letter provides important information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that our school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.  

  

#### **Personal Learning Device (PLD) for Secondary School Students**

2.     Overview. The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.  

3.     Purchase of PLD bundle. The school has made arrangements for you to purchase the PLD from Asiapac Distribution Pte Ltd for your child’s/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle includes warranty and insurance.

The price of the device bundle (inclusive of GST) is: S$842.00 

4.     Use of Edusave. If your child/ward is a Singapore citizen, you can use your child’s/ward’s Edusave to pay partly or fully for the PLD. A Singapore citizen student can use up to the available Edusave balance in his/her Edusave account to pay for the PLD after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. MOE has provided a one-off Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020, to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary students. Parents/guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted.

5.     Financial Assistance. Subsidies are available for students who require financial assistance to purchase a PLD. Please refer to the parent briefing slides for further details on funding support. Students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme for the year will automatically be subsidized for the PLD. Students who are currently not under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme may approach the school’s General Office to apply for additional subsidy if their Gross Household Income (GHI) is $4,000 or less, or Per Capita Income (PCI) is $1,000 or less. “PCI” refers to the Gross Household Income divided by the total number of family members in the household.

6.     Cyber-wellness. In rolling out the PLD, MOE is acutely aware of concerns regarding students’ cyber-wellness. The DMA allows the school to manage this, by

  

(a)    collecting data on usage by the student, such as the amount of time spent on each application,

(b)    monitoring, filtering and limiting the type of websites accessible to the student, and

(c)    placing restrictions on students’ screen time in order to prevent cyber addiction.

Please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on the DMA as well as MOE’s collection of data.

7.     Applications. As part of the NDLP, schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital to students’ learning experience and educational journey. In the following months, the school will roll out some or all of the following applications:

(a)   Student iCON: Every secondary school student will be given an email address. This is a service provided by Google as part of Google Suite.

(b)   Microsoft Pro Plus: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.

(c)   Zoom: Every secondary school student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 mins time limit using the Student iCON for the students’ video conferencing needs. 

Schools may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above. The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s personal data such as his/her name and class to set up user accounts. Please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on the collection of data via these applications.
