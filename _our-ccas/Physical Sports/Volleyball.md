### Background

Both Yuhua Secondary and Shuqun Secondary have a long history of excellence and success in Volleyball. This strength in Volleyball continued with the reborn Yuhua Secondary when the two schools merged in 2019. Our volleyball CCA provides many opportunities for student to grow in confidence and courage. By demanding the highest standards from our volleyballers, we know that this habit of excellence will spread into other aspects of their lives. Our vision is to nurture every volleyballer into men and women who embody teamwork, discipline and resilience.
