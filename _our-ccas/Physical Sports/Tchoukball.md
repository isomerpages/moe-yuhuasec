<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Tchoukball is a relatively new sport that is gaining popularity in Singapore.
It is a non-contact sport that is excellent for team-building and inculcating
qualities such as self-confidence, respect and honesty. Played by a team
of 7 players-a-side on a court, this is a game that is played by both boys
and girls. Opponents are not allowed to intercept or prevent the passing
of the ball during play. Points are scored in Tchoukball by throwing the
ball at a netted frame, which is placed at both ends of the court, and
when the opponents are unable to catch the rebound.
<br>Tchoukball gained new ground in 2023, starting with the Singapore Women’s
Tchoukball Team emerging as the world’s top team after beating 30-year
reigning champion Chinese Taipei at the Asia Pacific Tchoukball Championships.
With this resounding achievement, Tchoukball was formally recognized as
a National School Games (NSG)!
<br>Tchoukball was first introduced in Yuhua Sec as a CCA in 2012. Through
Yuhua Tchoukball, we aspire to motivate student athletes to develop as
excellent sportsmen and sportswomen who constantly strive to improve themselves
and to demonstrate good sportsmanship.</p>
