### Background
Tchoukball is a relatively new sport that is gaining popularity in Singapore. It is a non-contact sport that is excellent for team-building and inculcating qualities such as self-confidence, respect and honesty. Played by a team of 7 players-a-side on a court, this is a game that is played by both boys and girls. Opponents are not allowed to intercept or prevent the passing of the ball during play. Points are scored in Tchoukball by throwing the ball at a netted frame, which is placed at both ends of the court, and when the opponents are unable to catch the rebound.<br>Tchoukball gained new ground in 2023, starting with the Singapore Women’s Tchoukball Team emerging as the world’s top team after beating 30-year reigning champion Chinese Taipei at the Asia Pacific Tchoukball Championships. With this resounding achievement, Tchoukball was formally recognized as a National School Games (NSG)!<br>Tchoukball was first introduced in Yuhua Sec as a CCA in 2012. Through Yuhua Tchoukball, we aspire to motivate student athletes to develop as excellent sportsmen and sportswomen who constantly strive to improve themselves and to demonstrate good sportsmanship.
