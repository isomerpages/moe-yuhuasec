<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Yuhua Floorball Team was formed at the beginning of 2019 with the
merger of Yuhua Secondary’s Hockey Team and Shuqun Secondary’s Floorball
Team. The CCA has always maintained a focus of developing passion for the
sport and moulding students to be leaders in their own way. Over the years,
Yuhua Floorball has grown as a team, with each member dedicating their
time and effort to each training and competition. As members of the Floorball
team, students are given the platform to represent the school in the National
School Games (NSG) B and C Division tournament as well as friendly matches
on a yearly basis.</p>
