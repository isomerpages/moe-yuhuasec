### Background

The Yuhua Floorball Team was formed at the beginning of 2019 with the merger of Yuhua Secondary’s Hockey Team and Shuqun Secondary’s Floorball Team. The CCA has always maintained a focus of developing passion for the sport and moulding students to be leaders in their own way. Over the years, Yuhua Floorball has grown as a team, with each member dedicating their time and effort to each training and competition.  As members of the Floorball team, students are given the platform to represent the school in the National School Games (NSG) B and C Division tournament as well as friendly matches on a yearly basis.
