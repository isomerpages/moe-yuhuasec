# **Wushu**



### Background

The Yuhua Wushu Team was established in March 2008, under the influence of Mr Vincent Ng, an ex-Yuhuan who became a Wushu World Champion.&nbsp;
Although most of our members join us with little or no experience in the sport, many are able to put up quality performances after a few months of learning cool moves such as the double flying kick and butterfly twist. They also master weapons ranging from fists, daggers, swords, broadswords to cudgels and spears.&nbsp;
Being both a competitive sport and a performing art, we compete in two national level competitions every year, and are invited to perform for many of our school’s functions.

一动一静皆功夫，能文能武裕华人

Wushu, a traditional Chinese martial art, is not just a physical practice, but also about developing character while at the same time emphasizing teamwork and unity. To achieve a great performance, Yuhua Wushu team embodies the principles of “one heart, one mind and one team.”. The smooth and powerful movements embody the self-discipline and resilience of the wushu team, while the graceful and skillful techniques demonstrate their perseverance and confidence. Our team awaits you, a future Kung Fu Master!
