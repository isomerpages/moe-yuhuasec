### Background

The Yuhua Wushu Team was established in March 2008, under the influence of Mr Vincent Ng, an ex-Yuhuan who became a Wushu World Champion.  

Although most of our members join us with little or no experience in the sport, many are able to put up quality performances after a few months of learning cool moves such as the double flying kick and butterfly twist. They also master weapons ranging from fists, daggers, swords, broadswords to cudgels and spears.  

Being both a competitive sport and a performing art, we compete in two national level competitions every year, and are invited to perform for many of our school’s functions.

Wushu is the best place to build self-discipline, resilience, mental toughness and physical strength - attributes which will stand us in good stead in life. Our team awaits you, a future Kung Fu Master!
