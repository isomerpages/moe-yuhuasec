### Background

The Yuhua Infocomm and Media Club consists of teachers and students who have strong initiative and innovative in media, audio and video production. We are responsible in making sure that the school’s video and audio system are functioning for assemblies and events. The club is also ready to contribute and support the school in developing students who are keen in IT, photography and event management.
