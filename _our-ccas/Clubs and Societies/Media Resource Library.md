### Background

**Our Vision**   
A vibrant library to empower learning

**Our Mission**   
To provide resources and environment for students to excel as competent learners in the 21st Century

**Our Motto**   
Bringing curiosity alive

In Yuhua secondary School, the Media Resource Library (MRL) called infoasis, actively promotes the Joy of Reading and wants each and every student to be a strong reader and a lifelong learner. It also aims to play a key role in developing 21st Century Competencies in our
students and has been evolving in many ways to cater to our digital readers.

The Infoasis Council’s vision is to create “A vibrant library to empower learning”. To achieve this vision, we have introduced resources and an environment for Yuhuans to excel in the 21st Century. Acknowledging our Yuhuans’ wishes for a conducive study environment, a normal school day will see many students engaging in active collaboration at discussion tables found throughout the Infoasis. The large  learning space in the Infoasis also provides the opportunity for student workshops and dialogue sessions to be held here.

### Key Events of the Year

In the Library CCA, our student librarians are called “Info Ambassadors” in line with the name of the library as InfOasis. Info ambassadors are provided with opportunities to take on the role as event managers for programmes held in the activity space. Some of the events we have had include Characters come alive, National day, International friendship day, and Blind date with books.     

Librarian’s @work:There was a continuous focus on book promotion skills where Info Ambassadors (student librarians) underwent training on giving a one-minute book promotion followed by hands on activities. Despite the current pandemic and social distancing measures, Info Ambassadors have stayed resilient and adopted creative means to promote books they have read through the use of infographics.

**Thematic displays by Info ambassadors**

Info Ambassadors worked on thematic displays based on local and overseas writers.  These book displays help to boost students’ interest in different genres of books, and expose them to new and current collections in the library.

*   Pocket-Sized Programme (Monthly Thematic Book Displays) and Other Displays Linked to Festivals/Cultures in Singapore. 
*   Every month, our info ambassadors prepare book displays and activities linked to different exciting topics or themes e.g. Chinese New Year, Know Your Library, Get to Know OPAC, Books to Movies, Racial Harmony Day, etc.

**World Book Day 2021** 

Info ambassadors and EL teachers were able to use their creativity to dress up as their favourite book characters creating a colourful parade representing a wide variety of novels, from Alice in Wonderland, and Macbeth to Where’s Wally and Harry Potter. The students had a wonderful time, sharing about their favourite characters and storybooks with their friends on the world book day, conducted by the EL department.
