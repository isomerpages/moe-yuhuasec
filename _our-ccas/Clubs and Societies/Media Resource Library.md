<h3>Key Events of the Year</h3>
<p><strong>Student Librarians @ Work:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our student librarians not only facilitate the smooth functioning of the
library but also take on the role of event managers, organising impactful
programmes in the library's activity space. Throughout the year, they curate
and set up engaging displays, such as those celebrating World Book Day,
World Environment Day, and significant national events like National Day
and Racial Harmony Day. By actively participating in these events, the
student librarians empower fellow Yuhuans to become responsible readers
and conscientious citizens of the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>Thematic displays:</strong>

</div>
<p>The student librarians create thematic displays based on both local and
international writers. These displays showcase a wide range of genres and
introduce students to new and current collections available in the library.
By boosting Yuhuans' interest in various literary genres, the student librarians
broaden their reading horizons and empower them to explore different types
of literature.</p>
<p><strong>Book Promotion:</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the key focuses of the student librarians is honing their book
promotion skills. Through training, they learn how to deliver compelling
one-minute book promotions, captivating their peers' attention and sparking
their interest in diverse literary works. By incorporating hands-on activities
into their promotions, the student librarians ensure that fellow Yuhuans
actively engage with the books, fostering a deeper connection and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>World Book Day:</strong>
</p>
<p>A significant highlight for the student librarians and English Language
teachers is the vibrant celebration of World Book Day. On this special
occasion, they unleash their creativity and dress up as their favorite
book characters, transforming the school into a colourful parade of literary
figures. This collaborative effort sparks lively conversations among students,
as they enthusiastically share their favorite characters and storybooks
with one another. By immersing themselves in the world of literature, our
student librarians and teachers inspire a love for reading and storytelling
among their peers.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling Workshop:</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the student librarians’ co-curricular development, a storytelling
workshop was conducted by an external trainer to enhance members’ public
speaking skills and build their confidence in communication.</p>
<p>Through the interactive session, members learned valuable techniques on
how to structure and deliver stories that engage and inspire audiences.
They were also given the opportunity to present their stories creatively
and meaningfully, applying voice modulation, expression, and gestures to
make their presentations more impactful.</p>
<p>The workshop was a valuable learning experience that equipped our student
librarians with essential communication skills, fostering greater confidence
and poise when addressing an audience.</p>
