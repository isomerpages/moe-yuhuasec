<h3>Key Events of the Year</h3>
<p><strong>Info Ambassadors @ Work:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our student librarians proudly hold the title of "Info Ambassadors." These
dedicated individuals not only facilitate the smooth functioning of the
library but also take on the role of event managers, organising impactful
programmes in the library's activity space. Throughout the year, they curate
and set up engaging displays, such as those celebrating World Book Day,
World Environment Day, and significant national events like National Day
and Racial Harmony Day. By actively participating in these events, the
Info Ambassadors empower fellow Yuhuans to become responsible readers and
conscientious citizens of the 21st century.</p>

international writers. These displays showcase a wide range of genres and
introduce students to new and current collections available in the library.
By boosting Yuhuans' interest in various literary genres, the Info Ambassadors

<p>One of the key focuses of the Info Ambassadors is honing their book promotion
skills. Through training, they learn how to deliver compelling one-minute
book promotions, captivating their peers' attention and sparking their
interest in diverse literary works. By incorporating hands-on activities
into their promotions, the Info Ambassadors ensure that fellow Yuhuans
actively engage with the books, fostering a deeper connection and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>World Book Day:</strong>
</p>
<p>A significant highlight for the Info Ambassadors and English Language
teachers is the vibrant celebration of World Book Day. On this special
occasion, they unleash their creativity and dress up as their favorite
book characters, transforming the school into a colourful parade of literary
figures. This collaborative effort sparks lively conversations among students,
as they enthusiastically share their favorite characters and storybooks
with one another. By immersing themselves in the world of literature, the
Info Ambassadors and teachers inspire a love for reading and storytelling
among their peers.</p>
