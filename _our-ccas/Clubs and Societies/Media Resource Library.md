### Key Events of the Year

**Info Ambassadors @ Work**

Our student librarians proudly hold the title of "Info Ambassadors." These dedicated individuals not only facilitate the smooth functioning of the library but also take on the role of event managers, organising impactful programmes in the library's activity space. Throughout the year, they curate and set up engaging displays, such as those celebrating World Book Day, World Environment Day, and significant national events like National Day and Racial Harmony Day. By actively participating in these events, the Info Ambassadors empower fellow Yuhuans to become responsible readers and conscientious citizens of the 21st century.

**Thematic displays**

Info Ambassadors worked on thematic displays based on local and overseas writers.  These book displays help to boost students’ interest in different genres of books, and expose them to new and current collections in the library.

*   Pocket-Sized Programme (Monthly Thematic Book Displays) and Other Displays Linked to Festivals/Cultures in Singapore. 
*   Every month, our info ambassadors prepare book displays and activities linked to different exciting topics or themes e.g. Chinese New Year, Know Your Library, Get to Know OPAC, Books to Movies, Racial Harmony Day, etc.

**World Book Day 2021** 

Info ambassadors and EL teachers were able to use their creativity to dress up as their favourite book characters creating a colourful parade representing a wide variety of novels, from Alice in Wonderland, and Macbeth to Where’s Wally and Harry Potter. The students had a wonderful time, sharing about their favourite characters and storybooks with their friends on the world book day, conducted by the EL department.
