### Background of Robotics Club

Yuhua’s Tinkering and Robotic Club strives to provide a platform for students to express their innovation and design thinking mindset through coding and robotics. Making an effective robot is always a challenging task requiring lots of experimentation, imagination and passion. Our student builders and programmers always work hard to equip themselves with the required skills. The club’s members experience various hands-on opportunities to design and code to solve real world problems. We aim to nature our members to care, connect and contribute effectively. Members will display the values of curiosity, respect, responsibility, and adaptability.
