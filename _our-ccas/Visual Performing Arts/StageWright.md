<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Yuhua Stagewright Society was started in 2013, in an attempt to offer
an alternative platform where students can develop their talents and skills
holistically as actors, stage managers, scriptwriters, prop masters, makeup
artists and wardrobe masters in a creative and nurturing environment. As
a member of the society, one will also be provided with opportunities to
interact with various drama communities and the industry’s professionals
via face-to-face or online platforms. Our weekly CCA Training sessions
focus on the history of theatre and the different genres of theatre to
sharpen students’ creativity and hone our drama and acting techniques and
skills, Many others participated in an MOE online audition for student
actors and presenters in their video productions. This was indeed an opportunity
for the students to hone their presentation skills and self-confidence,
while showing their talents.</p>
