### Background

The Yuhua Stagewright Society was started in 2013, in an attempt to offer an alternative platform where students can develop their talents and skills holistically as actors, stage managers, scriptwriters, prop masters, makeup artists and wardrobe masters in a creative and nurturing environment. As a member of the society, one will also be provided with opportunities to interact with various drama communities and the industry’s professionals via face-to-face or online platforms. Our weekly CCA Training sessions focus on the history of theatre and the different genres of theatre to sharpen students’ creativity and hone our drama and acting techniques and skills, 
Those interested to experience life as a student in the dance and theatre programmes at LASALLE also participated in an online programme where they gained a first-hand experience engaging with LASALLE students or being taught by the LASALLE lecturers. Many others participated in an MOE online audition for student actors and presenters in their video productions. This was indeed an opportunity for the students to hone their presentation skills and self-confidence, while showing their talents.
