<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The school merger in 2019 resulted in the merger of the Concert Bands
of Shuqun and Yuhua, both of which had a rich history and achieved numerous
accolades over the last 30 years. We have taken the opportunity to create
an even greater culture for music appreciation and growth among the students,
which our bandsmen will continue to benefit from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides inculcating values such as self-discipline, responsibility, and
resilience during and beyond band practices, our bandsmen are also given
opportunities to participate in enriching programmes such as overseas trips
and exchanges, to gain more experiences and build up their confidence.
They will also be able to experience performing, exchanging ideas, and
honing their skills with talented musicians from local and overseas bands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yuhua Concert Band is under the tutelage and mentoring of our conductor,
Ms Chan Peck Suan. Ms Chan is an experienced music educator, and her passion
and dedication has produced many skilled musicians who have gone on to
become professional musicians. We also have Yuhua Concert Band alumnus
Mr Benny Goh as our assistant conductor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that dedication leads to excellence, and that our hard work
and dedication will allow us to build on the Yuhua Concert Band’s legacy.</p>
