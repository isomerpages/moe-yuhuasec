### Background

The Boys' Brigade (BB) is the world's first uniformed organisation for youth. The impact of The Boys’ Brigade led to the establishment of other uniformed organisations: Church Lads’ Brigade (1890), Boys’ Life Brigade (1899), The Jewish Lads’ Brigade (1900), Girls’ Life Brigade (1902), Boy Scouts (1908) and Girl Guides (1910). All these organisations trace their genesis to 1883 and Sir William A. Smith.

The 28th Singapore Company was started in 1968 and co-sponsored by Jurong Christian Church. Previously based in Shuqun Secondary School, the company has been based in Yuhua Secondary School since the merger of the two schools in 2019.
