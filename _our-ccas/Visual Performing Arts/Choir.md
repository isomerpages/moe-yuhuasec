### Background

The Choir aims to inculcate a love of music in its members. Formed in 2016, the Choir is a relatively young but vibrant CCA that encourages confidence and creativity in our members through the art of music-making and singing. Members are trained by experienced instructors from the Kodaly Academy of Music and develop holistically through a comprehensive program that includes rehearsals, workshops, choir exchanges, concert attendance and performances. 

The Choir participated in the SYF 2017 and 2019 and clinched a Certificate of Accomplishment in both years. The Choir also helps develop students to take the Enhanced Music Programme (EMP) offered at our school in preparation for the GCE O Level Music exam.

### Key Events of the Year

Covid-19 has presented a unique set of challenges for our Yuhua Choir since 2020. Adhering to Safe Distancing Measurements meant that we had to do our Choir rehearsals differently: Zoom meetings, rehearsing in groups of not more than five in different classrooms and focusing more on music theory and musicianship skills. 

Despite this, the Choir managed to add some festive cheer to the Chinese New Year celebrations by putting up a multi-language song item

which included the different racial groups! A few students (and even alumni) from other CCAs collaborated with us by being our musicians.
