### Background

Formed in 2016, the Yuhua Secondary School Choir is an energetic CCA that encourages confidence and creativity in our members through the art of music-making and singing. 

To prepare and develop our choristers to be ready, resilient and confident, the YHSS Choir strives to uphold our culture of vibrancy, coupled with care. 

Our choristers are trained by experienced instructors from the Kodaly Academy of Music through comprehensive programmes that include: choir exchanges, concert attendance, performances, participation in the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation and workshops like Choral Masterclasses. 

Together with our instructors, parents and community partners, the YHSS Choir will continue to provide rich learning experiences and opportunities to hone our choristers’ musical knowledge and skills. We also believe in nurturing our choristers beyond their passion in music; to be active learners and responsible citizens who will be able to contribute to the school and even to the wider society in meaningful ways.
