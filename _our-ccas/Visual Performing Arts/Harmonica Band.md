<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Yuhua Harmonica Band was formed in 1986 and it has become a close-knit
family whose main interest is in promoting musical diversity through the
use of harmonica music among the students in the school. Besides cultivating
members’ musical talents and providing opportunities for members to explore
a wide range of genres, especially using the harmonica to play current
hit songs, the Band also hones the leadership and team-playing abilities
of the members. Students with little or no musical background have been
trained to enjoy, appreciate and have an intrinsic love for music. Today,
the Yuhua Harmonica Band is under the baton of our very own alumnus, Ms
He Hui Teng, who grew her passion for harmonica music while she was in
the school Band. She, together with all the teachers-in-charge, are dedicated
to bringing Yuhua Harmonica Band to greater heights, just as our motto
goes “Unite as One, to Achieve and Excel”.
