# **Harmonica Band**

### Background

Since its humble beginning in 1986, the Yuhua Harmonica Band has become a close-knit family whose main interest is in promoting Harmonica music among the students in the school. Besides cultivating members’ musical talents, the band also hones their leadership and team-playing abilities. Students with little or no musical background in music have been trained to enjoy, appreciate and have an intrinsic love for music.

Today, the Yuhua Harmonica Band is under the baton of our very own alumnus, who grew their passion for Harmonica music while they were in the school band. Ms He Hui Teng, our main instructor, and Mr Melvyn Ng, our assistant instructor, are dedicated to bringing the band to greater heights.
