# **Harmonica Band**

### Background
Since its humble beginning in 1986, the Yuhua Harmonica Band has become a close-knit family whose main interest is in promoting Harmonica music among the students in the school. Besides cultivating members’ musical talents, the band also hones their leadership and team-playing abilities. Students with little or no musical background in music have been trained to enjoy, appreciate and have an intrinsic love for music.
Today, the Yuhua Harmonica Band is under the baton of our very own alumnus, Ms He Hui Teng, who grew her passion for Harmonica music while she was in the school band. She is dedicated to bringing the band to greater heights, just as our motto goes “Unite as One, to Achieve and Excel”.
