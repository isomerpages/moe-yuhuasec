<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Experience a transformative journey with our NCC cadet program, designed
to cultivate a diverse range of skills. From the moment they join, cadets
are immersed in a culture of unity and camaraderie, forming lasting bonds
within the NCC (Land) training community. As Secondary Twos progress, they
engage in intermediate-level Drills, unlocking the gateway to their 'Adventurous
Spirit' through thrilling experiences. Moving forward, Secondary Threes
undergo advanced Drill training and step into leadership roles, empowering
them to plan and execute activities, fostering invaluable qualities like
initiative and decision-making. Over four years, cadets embrace physical,
mental, and emotional challenges, acquiring essential attributes such as
leadership, discipline, and teamwork. By developing these skills, cadets
emerge as confident individuals, fully prepared for National Service. Above
all, Yuhua NCC is dedicated to nurturing compassionate, connected, and
contributing students, instilling a sense of care and community engagement
that extends beyond the school walls.</p>
