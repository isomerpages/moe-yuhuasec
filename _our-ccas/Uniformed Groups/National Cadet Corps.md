### Background

Our NCC cadets are trained in a variety of skills, starting with a focus on bonding and induction into the NCC (Land) training culture. Secondary Twos will learn intermediate-level Drills and have more opportunities to foster their 'Adventurous Spirit'. Secondary Threes will learn advanced Drills and are exposed to leadership roles, where they are given opportunities to plan and execute activities. Their four-year involvement with NCC will provide much needed physical, mental and emotional challenges that will teach cadets leadership, discipline and teamwork. These skills enables cadets to be more confident and ready for National Service. More, importantly, Yuhua NCC strives to nurture students who are able to Care, Connect and Contribute to both the school and the larger community.
