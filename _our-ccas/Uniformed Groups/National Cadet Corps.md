### Background
Experience a transformative journey with our NCC cadet program, designed to cultivate a diverse range of skills. From the moment they join, cadets are immersed in a culture of unity and camaraderie, forming lasting bonds within the NCC (Land) training community. As Secondary Twos progress, they engage in intermediate-level Drills, unlocking the gateway to their 'Adventurous Spirit' through thrilling experiences. Moving forward, Secondary Threes undergo advanced Drill training and step into leadership roles, empowering them to plan and execute activities, fostering invaluable qualities like initiative and decision-making. Over four years, cadets embrace physical, mental, and emotional challenges, acquiring essential attributes such as leadership, discipline, and teamwork. By developing these skills, cadets emerge as confident individuals, fully prepared for National Service. Above all, Yuhua NCC is dedicated to nurturing compassionate, connected, and contributing students, instilling a sense of care and community engagement that extends beyond the school walls.
