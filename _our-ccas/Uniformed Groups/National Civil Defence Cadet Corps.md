<p>Yuhua NCDCC provides opportunities for our cadets to hone their leadership
and communication skills while serving the school through the administering
of first aid during school events such as Sports Day and Emergency Evacuation
Exercises. Additionally, our cadets serve as Civil Defence ambassadors,
