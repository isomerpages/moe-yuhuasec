### Background

Yuhua NCDCC has experienced significant growth since its inception, evolving from a modest unit comprising only 20 cadets to approximately 70 cadets at present. The NCDCC's distinctive emphasis lies in equipping its members with essential Civil Defence skills, including first aid, fire prevention, and fire-fighting.
Demonstrating their commitment to serving the school, NCDCC cadets are readily available to administer First Aid during various school events, such as Sports Day, and Emergency Evacuation Exercises, among others. Additionally, NCDCC cadets serve as ambassadors, raising awareness about Civil Defence initiatives.
NCDCC cadets also partake in a meticulously designed, varied, and challenging training program. Engaging visits to notable sites like the Civil Defence Heritage Gallery, Civil Defence Academy, and CD Shelter provide cadets with invaluable opportunities to acquire Civil Defence knowledge in an enjoyable and lasting manner. To put their acquired skills to the test, cadets actively participate in various competitions organized by the Home Team Academy, including the Urban Adventure Challenge and Precision Drill Competition.
