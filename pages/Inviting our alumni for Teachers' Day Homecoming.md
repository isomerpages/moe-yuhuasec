# **Inviting our alumni for Teachers' Day Homecoming!**

Yuhua Secondary School warmly welcomes our alumni to come visit the school on 1st September, 2022! Take a visit on that morning from 10.30am to 12pm to see for yourself how the school environment has improved and changed.  Also see if you can meet and reconnect with friends and teachers who had accompanied you through your secondary school year!
