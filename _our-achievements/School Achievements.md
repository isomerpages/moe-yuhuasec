### Green Schools @ Southwest 2021

We are proud to inform that our school has attained the **Three Stars – Public Health, Environment Protection and JEA Stars** for year 2021 in the Green Schools @ Southwest Award. This award is given to schools for their environmental efforts in reaching out to students and the school community at large.

Yuhua Secondary School has been participating in the Green Schools @ Southwest programme organised by National Environment Agency (NEA) since the early 2000s. We take pride in announcing that, with our environmental education programmes for Yuhuans, the school has been able to sustain the highest tier of recognition under this programme over the years.

We look forward to continuing our journey towards sustainability in many valuable and meaningful ways.
