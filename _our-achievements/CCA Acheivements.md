### Co-Curricular Activities in Yuhua

Co-Curricular Activities are important platforms for Yuhuans to explore their interests, learn new skills and build character. We are proud of the recognition given to our CCAs and individual Yuhuans for their efforts and excellence, and more importantly, how they have lived out the schoolâ€™s values and worked as a team to make it possible.

**Uniformed Groups (UG)**

As part of their programs, our Uniformed Groups go through an annual performance review and are benchmarked with other schools by their respective headquarters. We are glad to share that our Uniformed Groups grow from strength to strength and were recognized for their efforts over the years.
