### Co-Curricular Activities in Yuhua

Co-Curricular Activities are important platforms for Yuhuans to explore their interests, learn new skills and build character. We are proud of the recognition given to our CCAs and individual Yuhuans for their efforts and excellence, and more importantly, how they have lived out the school’s values and worked as a team to make it possible.

**Uniformed Groups (UG)**

As part of their programs, our Uniformed Groups go through an annual performance review and are benchmarked with other schools by their respective headquarters. We are glad to share that our Uniformed Groups grow from strength to strength and were recognized for their efforts over the years.

**Visual & Performing Arts (VPA)**

Our Visual and Performing Arts groups have also been a source of school pride, and do well nationally as well.

The SYF provides an opportunity for our Yuhuans to demonstrate their talents and be benchmarked against other schools. Our Visual and Performing Arts groups have done the school proud in recent years.
