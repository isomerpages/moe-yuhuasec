Tamil Chudar Awards are organized by Mediacorp’s Tamil News & CA and Tamil Language Learning & Promotion. The Awards are among the many initiatives Mediacorp’s Tamil News & Current Affairs and Tamil Language Learning & Promotion Committee have undertaken to foster greater links with the Indian community. The Awards are specifically aimed at recognizing significant contributions of individuals, schools, organisations and groups that help towards sustaining and promoting the Tamil language and its further development.

A total of 5 categories of awards: Education (Individual or Group), Arts, Youth Achiever, Lifetime Achiever and Special award. Only the Education, Arts and Youth Achiever categories are open for nomination. Recipients of the Lifetime Achiever and Special awards will be selected by an internal panel of judges.

Our school nominated the TL unit for the Education (Group) category. The result was announced on 11 Mar, and we are one of the winners for this award!

**The criteria for Education (Individual or Group):**  

Has undertaken initiatives to promote Tamil language which should extend beyond one’s job scope and expected duties within the school (e.g. initiatives above and beyond school-level programmes/projects, initiatives undertaken for Cluster or Zonal projects, collaborative efforts with community partners etc.)
