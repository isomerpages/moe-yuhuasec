# **Learning for Life (LLP)**
Yuhua Secondary School’s Learning for Life (LLP) programme, MELODY (Music Empowered Learners, Our Dynamic Yuhuans) is designed to create authentic and engaging arts learning experiences for our students to develop holistically. Beyond equipping students with skills to perform and express themselves, the arts provide platforms for students to collaborate and develop traits and dispositions like determination, tenacity, a desire for excellence, and exercise critical and creative thinking. 
### **Key / Milestone Programmes**
Yuhua Secondary School’s LLP framework is structured around a tiered approach to provide a balanced mix of programmes that will meet the learning needs and aspirations of all students.

Through a wide range of tactile, digital, and audience-based learning experiences introduced progressively from Secondary One onwards, students have multiple opportunities to explore the arts, ignite their interests, pursue their passion, and grow their talents. In school, students also have access to various performing arts spaces to enjoy a leisurely jam session, or perform for an audience.
