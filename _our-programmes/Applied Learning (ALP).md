### Background

Our school Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Coding, Design Thinking and Robotics (CODER) curriculum emphasises STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics)-related, project-based learning. It engages students in a series of challenging STEAM projects designed to connect classroom instruction to real-world problems.

### Programme Objective

CODER aims to   

1.  cultivate an innovative and design thinking mindset in students through a curriculum that encourage them to solve real and authentic problems through coding and robotics. 
2.  develop proficiency in analytical thinking and come up with solutions and responses beyond that which is rote or rule-based. 
3.  appreciate the range and power of coding and robotics, and foster an interest in, enjoyment of, and confidence in the use of digital technology.

### Key Programme

The programme introduces Scratch (developed by MIT Media Lab) and micro-controller programming to students to provide basic coding experience. Through Scratch and micro-controllers, all students will go through a series of structured programmes where they will be equipped with essential content knowledge on the programming languages, Robotic basics, tools, and problem-solving. 3D printing technology will be introduced as one of the platforms to realise their ideas in solving the problems.   

The programme is also balanced with a focus on soft skills, which include presentation and communication. Students are required to work in teams for data research, information analysis, and field work that will involve critical and inventive thinking, reasoning and decision making.
