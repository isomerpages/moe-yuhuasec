<h3><strong>Applied Learning (ALP): </strong>Yuhua Change Makers</h3>
<p>At Yuhua Secondary School, we are committed to nurturing students who
Care, Connect, and Contribute. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), "Yuhua
Changemakers", focuses on Design Thinking to develop 21st Century Competencies
(21CCs) and create holistic learners ready to tackle future challenges.
We aim to cultivate innovative mindsets and analytical thinking skills
in our students, preparing them to make meaningful contributions to society.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the Yuhua ALP, we strive to develop students who:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have a heart of empathy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect knowledge and insights across disciplines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideate and act on innovative solutions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on Design Thinking and nurturing these competencies, we aim
to prepare our students to be responsible citizens who can make meaningful
contributions to Singapore and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach: The Design Thinking Process</strong>

<p>Through the course of the programme, students learn and apply the five
stages of Design Thinking:</p>

<p>The Design Thinking process is selected as the main applied foci in our
ALP as it forefronts empathy, developing the “Heart” of our students as
we nurture ‘Care, Connect, Contribute’ through the school values of Above
All, CARE3. It also challenges our students to put on inter-disciplinary
lenses when exploring different problems to construct a more comprehensive
understanding of issues at hand. Finally, it enables our students to generate
more feasible solutions to the problems of an increasingly complex world.</p>
