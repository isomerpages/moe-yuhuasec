<h3><strong>Applied Learning (ALP): </strong>Yuhua Change Makers</h3>
<p>At Yuhua Secondary School, we are committed to nurturing students who
Care, Connect, and Contribute. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), "Yuhua
Changemakers", focuses on Design Thinking to develop 21st Century Competencies
(21CCs) and create holistic learners ready to tackle future challenges.
We aim to cultivate innovative mindsets and analytical thinking skills
in our students, preparing them to make meaningful contributions to society.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the Yuhua ALP, we strive to develop students who:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have a heart of empathy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect knowledge and insights across disciplines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideate and act on innovative solutions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on Design Thinking and nurturing these competencies, we aim
to prepare our students to be responsible citizens who can make meaningful
contributions to Singapore and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach: The Design Thinking Process</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the course of the programme, students learn and apply the five
stages of Design Thinking:</p>

</div>
<p>The Design Thinking process is selected as the main applied foci in our
ALP as it forefronts empathy, developing the “Heart” of our students as
we nurture ‘Care, Connect, Contribute’ through the school values of Above
All, CARE3. It also challenges our students to put on inter-disciplinary
lenses when exploring different problems to construct a more comprehensive
understanding of issues at hand. Finally, it enables our students to generate
more feasible solutions to the problems of an increasingly complex world.</p>
<h4><strong>Programme Structure</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Tier 1: All Students</strong>
</p>
<p>Each cohort (Sec 1 – Sec 4/5) focuses on specific areas aligned with Singapore's
major growth sectors:</p>

<h4><strong>Secondary 1: </strong>Environmental Sustainability in School</h4>
<p>Using environmental sustainability as a core focus area, students will
learn the 5 stages of the DT Process and employ DT towards innovative solutions
for greater sustainability and green awareness in school.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Secondary 2:</strong> Social Innovations in Community</h4>
<p>At Secondary 2, students will be embarking on a journey into Design Thinking
for Social Innovations to the community around school. Partnering with
local stakeholders, students will be exposed to more complex social issues
that we face in our neighbouring community and engage them in using the
DT process to care-connect-contribute towards better outcomes for social
good.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Secondary 3-5:</strong> Design for the Future</h4>
<p>At Upper Secondary, students are now more ready to initiate their own
DT projects and make a difference to a core issue that is close to their
hearts. Working in alignment with the Social Studies curriculum, students
will take responsibility to champion for different projects of their passion,
with an encouragement to consider DT projects that may fall within Green,
Care and Digital growth areas.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Design Thinking Festival</strong></h4>
<p>The Tier 1 ALP across all cohorts culminates in a Design Thinking Festival
held annually in the last week of Term 4, where students will present their
projects to different members of the school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Tier 2: Targeted Student Groups</strong>
</p>
<p>At Tier 2 ALP, students will further deepen their development of 21CCs
and to grow DT skills at the forefront. We aim for our Tier 2 students
to be role models who can truly embody the spirit of Yuhua Changemakers
in the school and the community.</p>
<p>The Tier 2 programmes are divided into 2 main strands:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Exemplary Leadership Strand: Developing servant leadership skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DT Innovations Strand: Creating innovative solutions for school and community</p>
