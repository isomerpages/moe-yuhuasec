#### **After School Engagement Programme**

**Introduction**  

<img src="/images/2023%20images/yea_hub4.png" style="width:70%">

Our After School Engagement (ASE) programme - Yuhua Engagement Activity Hub (YEAHub) is meant to complement our co-curricular activity (CCA) programme and will operate on non-CCA days i.e. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 3.00pm to 5.30pm.
YEAHub complements and enhances the school’s efforts at pro-active student engagement and functions as a vehicle for creating a safe and conducive learning environment.
YEAHub crew members who are also known as the YEAHub Ambassadors, are guided by the teachers to plan and facilitate the Centre programmes for the school’s population.

**Programme Objectives**

The objectives of the YEAHub are:

1. To provide a safe and conducive environment for Yuhuans to drop in after school and be meaningfully engaged in social interactions and community learning.
2. To foster school connectedness and build quality relationships with trusted adults in a school environment.
3. To empower students to become effective leaders and active learners through purposeful programmes that engage the target students.
