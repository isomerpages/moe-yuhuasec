# **After School Engagement Programme**

**Introduction**  

Our After School Engagement (ASE) programme- YEAH Hub is meant to complement our co-curricular activity (CCA) programme and will operate on non-CCA days i.e. Mondays and Wednesdays from 3.00pm to 5.30pm.

The YEAH Hub will complement and enhance the schoolâ€™s efforts at pro-active student engagement and function as a vehicle for creating a safe and conducive learning environment.
