Our school’s Harmonica Band and Choir CCAs came together to plan for a cultural immersion trip to Taiwan in order to expose our students to other countries, cultures and better understand their role as a member of a global community.

**Programme Objectives**

To provide an opportunity for students in the Harmonica Band and Choir CCAs to :

1) Learn about the performing arts in Taiwan

2) Engage in cultural exchange with performing arts students in a local Taiwanese school

3) Learn about the culture and history of Taiwan 

**Key Programme**

Musical exchange programme with Nei-Hu Junior High School

Our Student put up a joint performance (Choir Singing together with Harmonica Accompaniment) for their Taiwanese Counterparts, who then performed some of their Ethnic songs for our students.Though there were some language barriers, music provided a common language that both groups of students were able to appreciate and enjoy. They then played some bonding games and exchanged tokens with one another.
