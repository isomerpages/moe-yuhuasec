<p>YHSS’ EMP students will have opportunities to pursue deeper learning in
various musical pursuits. Through an in-depth study of various musical
traditions, such as Western Classical music, Asian Music, Jazz, and Pop,
students will engage in rich learning experiences that involve listening,
performing, composing, and theoretical study. Our EMP students will also
participate in diverse enrichment activities, such as masterclasses with
industry professionals, learning journeys to higher education institutions
and cultural groups, and combined schools’ camps and showcase platforms
organised by the Ministry of Education.</p>
