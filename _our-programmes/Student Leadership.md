<h3>Introduction</h3>

</div>
<p>At Yuhua, we have adopted the principles of Servant Leadership by Robert
Greenleaf in alignment with our school values into four pillars of practices,
namely Serve, Plan, Grow and Support. We develop Servant Leaders who have
a heart that cares for others and a sense of responsibility to serve,&nbsp;
who care for others and a sense of responsibility to serve, who recognise
their own strengths and weaknesses and make an effort to grow themselves
in order to develop others and who are sensitive to social needs and help
build positive relationships and a community that flourishes.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Programme Objectives</h3>
<p>Yuhuan student leaders serve with purpose, pride and honour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student Leaders must start with the right intention, which is the desire
to care for and serve others. They should put in their best effort in serving
others and continually improve themselves to accomplish something that
they can be proud of. Student Leaders should preserve the honour of Student
Leadership by demonstrating integrity and being gracious towards others
at all times.</p>
<p>We aspire to develop Servant Leaders who are self-motivated and have the
desire to serve and who relate well with others and empathise with their
needs.</p>
