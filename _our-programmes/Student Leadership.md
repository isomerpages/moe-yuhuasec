<p>At YHSS, we believe in nurturing the next generation of leaders by providing
a comprehensive framework for student leadership development. Our student
leaders—including CCA (Co-Curricular Activity) leaders, class leaders,
and student councillors—play a vital role in shaping the school community
and upholding our core values.</p>
<p>Through their roles, our student leaders have the opportunity to grow
as individuals and contribute meaningfully to the school. Leadership at
YHSS is more than just a title—it is a journey of growth, responsibility,
and impact.</p>
