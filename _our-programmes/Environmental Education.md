# **Environmental Education**

**Through the school’s green policy, Yuhua Secondary School aims to:**

1. promote awareness of environmental issues that affect all Yuhuans, both locally and globally 

2. ensure efficient and optimal    
a. water usage    
b. waste management (reduce, reuse, recycle and repurpose)    
c. energy usage (electricity) 

3. ensure environmental sustainability in procurement of resources and services 
4. provide guidance and platforms for decision-making by students and staff in the school’s green efforts

Some programmes that are carried out annually include:

**1. Secondary 1 Environmental Pitch lesson** 

As part of our year end post-exam activity, this lesson is conducted as a half-day project-based activity, where students come up with models and pitches for several campaigns that the school can conduct the following year.

**2\. Overseas Learning Journey**  

Environmental education should not be limited to a classroom setting. Through an overseas learning journey to Cambodia, an annual programme partnering the school’ Humanities Department, the students were provided with an authentic context where they learned, shared and worked together with their Cambodian friends to tackle climate change. During the course of the trip, they learned about the following issues:

a) management of food waste   
b) the practice of the 3Rs- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and   
c) sustainable tourism.

**3. Foodprints** 

The school conducts food reduction awareness campaigns in order to inculcate good habits amongst students to avoid food wastage. Sec 4N and 4NT students are tasked to champion this campaign in school through a school Values in Action project. 

The students first work as independent learners to research on issues concerning food wastage. Utilizing CCE periods dedicated to their VIA project, they then plan their project using the service learning methodology to address the issue. 

The project encompasses the following forms: 

* Creating posters to be displayed in the classrooms
* Conducting an assembly talk
* putting up a game/ activity booth during the food Waste Carnival
* producing a skit to showcase the importance of food waste reduction

Last year, the Food Waste exhibition was held on 26 April 2019, where students’ skits were played on the screen in the canteen and a total of 8 booths with different activities on food waste were set up by the students for their juniors.
