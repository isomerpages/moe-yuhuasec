# **Environmental Education**

**Through the school’s green policy, Yuhua Secondary School aims to:**

1. promote awareness of environmental issues that affect all Yuhuans, both locally and globally 

2. ensure efficient and optimal    
a. water usage    
b. waste management (reduce, reuse, recycle and repurpose)    
c. energy usage (electricity) 

3. ensure environmental sustainability in procurement of resources and services 
4. provide guidance and platforms for decision-making by students and staff in the school’s green efforts

Some programmes that are carried out annually include:

**1. Secondary 1 Environmental Pitch lesson** 

As part of our year end post-exam activity, this lesson is conducted as a half-day project-based activity, where students come up with models and pitches for several campaigns that the school can conduct the following year.

**2\. Overseas Learning Journey**  

Environmental education should not be limited to a classroom setting. Through an overseas learning journey to Cambodia, an annual programme partnering the school’ Humanities Department, the students were provided with an authentic context where they learned, shared and worked together with their Cambodian friends to tackle climate change. During the course of the trip, they learned about the following issues:

a) management of food waste   
b) the practice of the 3Rs- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and   
c) sustainable tourism.
