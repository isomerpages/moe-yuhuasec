# **Positive Education**

**What is Positive Education?**

Positive Education is about empowering students with the skills of well-being and achievement to flourish in any environment.

**What is Well-Being?**

Well-being is about having a growth mind-set, finding joy and meaning in what I do and leveraging on my strengths to achieve and contribute to society.

**PERMA** is an acronym for a model of well-being put forth by a pioneer in the field of positive psychology, Martin Seligman. 

According to Seligman, **PERMA** makes up five important building blocks of well-being and happiness:

**Positive emotions** – feeling positive in who you are and what you do

**Engagement** – being completely absorbed in activities    
**Relationships** – being authentically connected to others   
**Meaning** – finding purpose and fulfillment in what you do    
**Achievement** – a sense of accomplishment and success
