<p>The aim of the Foundation Programme is to develop socio-emotional competencies
in our students that will enable them to grow in confidence and as individuals
who Care-Connect-Contribute to their family, school and community.</p>
<p>In Lower Secondary, we engage students in different fun-filled and hands-on
activities that provide opportunities for them to learn more about themselves
and develop social skills to interact with others.</p>
