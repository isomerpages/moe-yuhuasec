<p><strong>Cornerstone</strong> is YHSS’ whole-school approach to care-connect-contribute
towards our suite of UPLIFT initiatives.</p>
<p>According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the word ‘cornerstone’ refers to <strong><em>something of great importance that everything else depends on.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Our mission is to build <strong><em>Yuhuans of Character and Purpose Who Care, Connect and Contribute.</em></strong> We
aim to <strong>build all students up to the peak </strong>based on <strong><em>Maslow Hierarchy of Needs.</em></strong> Towards
this end, Cornerstone is our effort towards uplifting every Yuhuan – building
esteem and motivation by first ensuring with priority different foundational
needs are well taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>We enable Yuhuans to conquer the peak, by first laying a strong foundation.</strong>
