<p>Many of the YEAHub afterschool activities are initiated by the students
who often provide the school with suggestions to the type of activities
they enjoy. As a result, many of the YEAHub activities have become mainstay
programmes that are held regularly after school and students continue to
find joy in participating with their friends. We continue to invite and
encourage our students to initiate activities that they enjoy and provide
opportunities for like-minded individuals to come together to build meaningful
and positive friendships.&nbsp;</p>
