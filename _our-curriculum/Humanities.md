### Signature Programme(s)

**Sec 1 Historical Investigation**  

Sec 1 students embarked on their Historical Investigation, where they were required to investigate a given hypothesis. The fieldwork is part of their research and evidence gathering phase. The fieldwork was also facilitated by Sec 3 student docents who took over as nonyas, babas, coolies, opera actresses and immigrants. Students will then consolidate the information and share their findings between classes through visual and verbal presentations.

**Sec 2 Integrated Humanities Fieldwork:**

At Sec 2, students will embark on fieldwork, which revolves around the theme of housing and common spaces. Through this fieldwork, designed through Understanding by Design (UbD) model, students will learn about the concept of Change and Continuity. Students will be required to interview residents, collect necessary data and record their observation. They will then analyse the data based on their findings and answer the guiding questions which they have crafted.

**Sec 3 Integrated Humanities Fieldwork:**

Sec 3 Students will also embark on a fieldwork project that ties in the topic of Governance (from Social Studies) and Climate Change (Geography Elective/Geography). This fieldwork project is also designed based on UbD. Students will collect weather data for a period of 1 to 2 months, share data across the cohort, carry out research and observe the climatic trend. In their groups, students will then present the data, confirm the hypothesis and produce artefacts.

**Docents Programme**

The Docent Programme is introduced in 2019 as part of nurturing our students to be confident leaders. Through this programme, students acquire the skills and values to guide our young learners through the local fieldwork.
