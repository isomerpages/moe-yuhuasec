<h3>Signature Programme(s)</h3>
<p><strong>Sec 2 Integrated Humanities Fieldwork:</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2024, we have merged the Secondary 2 Integrated Humanities Fieldwork
with Flourish Week. Through this fieldwork, designed using the Understanding
by Design (UbD) model, students visit the Singapore River to answer the
question, "How has the Singapore River evolved to meet the needs of a sustainable
nation?" At the river, they are introduced to its heritage through engaging
activities that immerse them in its sights, sounds, and smells, enhancing
their appreciation and understanding of the river's rich history.</p>
<p><strong>Sec 3 Integrated Humanities Fieldwork:</strong>
</p>
<p>Sec 3 Students will also embark on a fieldwork project that ties in the
topic of Governance (from Social Studies) and Climate Change (Geography
Elective/Geography). This fieldwork project is also designed based on UbD.
Students will collect weather data for a period of 1 to 2 months, share
data across the cohort, carry out research and observe the climatic trend.
In their groups, students will then present the data, confirm the hypothesis
and produce artefacts.</p>
<p><strong>Docents Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Docents Programme, introduced in 2019, aims to nurture our students
into confident leaders. Through this programme, students develop 21st-century
skills through various activities. Some of the activities undertaken by
the docents include webinars, presentations on contemporary issues, facilitation
of learning journeys, and participation in Model United Nations. These
experiences not only enhance their knowledge and skills but also prepare
them to take on leadership roles in the future.</p>
