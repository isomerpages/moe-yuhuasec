<h2><strong>Talent development in YHSS</strong></h2>
<p>We value development of students who demonstrate talent and willingness
to explore different subject areas further. Our departments curate different
talent development programmes to develop a community of learners within
our school who can flourish.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Science Talent Development Programme</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Science Talent Development Programme was pioneered in 2025 with the
Secondary 2 cohort offering G3 Math and G3 Science with the dual objectives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies (with emphasis on critical, adaptive and inventive thinking
geared towards problem solving) and scientific literacy (with emphasis
on data-based decision making) among students of high learning readiness
for Science</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To expose students to concepts and
practical activities that will allow them exposure to Science as applied
in our lives, fostering greater civic literacy and appreciation for the
role of Science in our lives</p>
