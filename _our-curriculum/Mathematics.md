### CURRICULUM OBJECTIVES:
* To create a positive learning experience for students so that they develop confidence in problem solving.
* To encourage the practice of effective habits and routines to make learning more productive.
* To make acquisition of knowledge and skills interesting and meaningful.
* To provide feedback and interventions, focusing on effort and progress.

### Signature Programme(s)

**LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT**

**MOTIVATION:**<br>
Students have a growth mindset and enjoy learning. The PERMA model for Positive Education is adopted to provide students with the necessary motivation to engage in mathematics learning.

**MEMORY**
<br>Students learn, remember and recall math concepts correctly.&nbsp;

**MASTERY**<br>Students perform manipulations and calculations accurately.&nbsp;

**MODELLING**<br>
Students frame the problem, identify the approach and apply values-skills-knowledge in solving problems creatively.

**DESIRED STUDENT OUTCOMES**<br>
ACTIVE:<br>Students can work effectively independently and collaboratively to identify problems and seek out possible solutions.

ARTICULATE:<br>Students can present their solutions in a logical manner, stating reasons where necessary in written and verbal form.

ACCURATE:<br>Students can derive correct and feasible solutions, checking their answer against problem requirements and using alternative methods to verify answers where possible.

### PARTICIPATION AND ACHIEVEMENTS

The Mathematics Department Talent Development Programme enables students with strong interest and talent in Mathematics to challenge themselves by participating in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiads (SMO) and All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competitions.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the trainings were carried out online. The selected students demonstrated responsibility and resilience as they practiced on their own following and sought feedback from their teachers through virtual meetings.

### Academic Support Programmes

**1\. iBelieve and Booster Programmes**  
The iBelieve and Booster Programmes are targeted for selected lower secondary students. These after-school programmes aim to strengthen our students’ foundation in Mathematics and increase their level of confidence.  
  
So, what’s the feedback from the students? All of them agreed that they were happy and enjoying themselves as their teachers create positive learning environment during these afternoon activity lessons.

**2\. iSTRIVE Programme**

The iStrive programme supports students who have good achievements in Math at lower secondary and are offered Math in a more challenging stream as they progress to the next level.

The programme starts during the first few weeks of the November school holiday to cover topics in another stream so that these students are able to start the following year on an equal footing as their other peers.

To ensure adequate support in terms of their subject learning and emotional well-being, consultations will be held fortnightly throughout the students’ first year in a new stream.

### Home-based Learning

Home-based learning has become a vital learning platform for continual learning during the circuit breaker period. Teachers collaborated with each other to create more online learning resources and share them with colleagues to further enhance the effectiveness of home-based learning.

To encourage self-directed learning, the Mathematics department uploaded lesson materials for their classes in Student Learning Space (SLS). Assignments were marked and feedback given regularly for every assignment to ensure the continuity of students’ learning progress.

The Covid-19 pandemic has, in fact, created an opportunity for teachers to look at all the possibilities of learning experiences and platforms for our students by using ICT-enabled affordances in the future.
