### CURRICULUM OBJECTIVES:
* To create a positive learning experience for students so that they develop confidence in problem solving.
* To encourage the practice of effective habits and routines to make learning more productive.
* To make acquisition of knowledge and skills interesting and meaningful.
* To provide feedback and interventions, focusing on effort and progress.

### Signature Programme(s)

**LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT**

**MOTIVATION:**<br>
Students have a growth mindset and enjoy learning. The PERMA model for Positive Education is adopted to provide students with the necessary motivation to engage in mathematics learning.

**MEMORY**
<br>Students learn, remember and recall math concepts correctly.&nbsp;

**MASTERY**<br>Students perform manipulations and calculations accurately.&nbsp;

**MODELLING**<br>
Students frame the problem, identify the approach and apply values-skills-knowledge in solving problems creatively.

**2.&nbsp;Experiential Learning Activities**  

The Mathematics department provides opportunities for all students to enjoy learning through fun activities. Some of these activities go beyond the classroom environment such as learning journeys and classroom experiential learning activities.

Lower secondary students visited the Science Centre and enjoyed the Mass Escape Game and DinoQuest.

Upper secondary students were engaged in playing Math board games called Jungle Stumble in school. Students got very excited as the game was based not only on mathematical skills and understanding, but also pure luck! Therefore, anyone could win it.&nbsp;

Our teachers strive to provide a highly engaging environment during lesson enactment. We believe experiential learning would provide greater joy in the learning of Mathematics. For example, the teaching of the concept of factorisation and trigonometry can be made more fun &amp; enjoyable through concrete visualisations and measurement. Watch the two videos below on how the joy of learning math is made alive!

**3\. EBS iExperience programme**

Through the 2D1N EBS iExperience programme, students are immersed in various aspects of business and services so that they can find greater meaning in what they have learned. The activities for the learning journey will be based on lessons that have already been covered in the classroom. The information collected during the learning journey will be used for the mini‐coursework.

### Talent Development Programme

The Mathematics Department Talent Development Programme enables students with strong interest and talent in Mathematics to challenge themselves by participating in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiads (SMO) and All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competitions.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the trainings were carried out online. The selected students demonstrated responsibility and resilience as they practiced on their own following and sought feedback from their teachers through virtual meetings.

### Academic Support Programmes

**1\. iBelieve and Booster Programmes**  
The iBelieve and Booster Programmes are targeted for selected lower secondary students. These after-school programmes aim to strengthen our students’ foundation in Mathematics and increase their level of confidence.  
  
So, what’s the feedback from the students? All of them agreed that they were happy and enjoying themselves as their teachers create positive learning environment during these afternoon activity lessons.

**2\. iSTRIVE Programme**

The iStrive programme supports students who have good achievements in Math at lower secondary and are offered Math in a more challenging stream as they progress to the next level.

The programme starts during the first few weeks of the November school holiday to cover topics in another stream so that these students are able to start the following year on an equal footing as their other peers.

To ensure adequate support in terms of their subject learning and emotional well-being, consultations will be held fortnightly throughout the students’ first year in a new stream.

### Home-based Learning

Home-based learning has become a vital learning platform for continual learning during the circuit breaker period. Teachers collaborated with each other to create more online learning resources and share them with colleagues to further enhance the effectiveness of home-based learning.

To encourage self-directed learning, the Mathematics department uploaded lesson materials for their classes in Student Learning Space (SLS). Assignments were marked and feedback given regularly for every assignment to ensure the continuity of students’ learning progress.

The Covid-19 pandemic has, in fact, created an opportunity for teachers to look at all the possibilities of learning experiences and platforms for our students by using ICT-enabled affordances in the future.
