### Department Introduction    

The (MA)3 Mathematics Framework focuses on developing three key student competencies namely Memory, Mastery and Modelling. Students’ needs in each tier are addressed through various programmes and practices to optimise their learning. We have planned activities with customised learning approaches that are more student-centred to spark the Joy of Learning. There is more emphasis on thinking and metacognition although mastery learning remains an integral part of the program. The development of 21st century skills is purposefully integrated into programmes.   
  
Apart from competencies students must also have the right attitudes to continually adapt and grow in a world that is rapidly evolving and highly connected. Hence we emphasise three desired student attitudes in problem solving in Yuhua namely Active, Articulate and Accurate in the learning of Mathematics in Yuhua.

### Signature Programme(s)

**Joy of Learning Mathematics**

**1\. Y-Venture**

Y-Venture aims to excite the Joy of Learning Mathematics through gamifications and experiential learning.

During the learning activity, students work in small groups to solve a series of math-related problems which would then lead to more clues or number codes required to open the combination locks before they can escape from different rooms and finally be set free.

Y-Venture challenges students to reason, communicate and apply metacognitive skills that they have learnt in their Math class. Our escape rooms provides students great enjoyment in learning mathematics and at the same time, inculcates the values of resilience, perseverance and cooperation to complete the mission.
