**DESIRED STUDENT OUTCOMES**<br>
ACTIVE:<br>Students can work effectively independently and collaboratively to identify problems and seek out possible solutions.

ARTICULATE:<br>Students can present their solutions in a logical manner, stating reasons where necessary in written and verbal form.

ACCURATE:<br>Students can derive correct and feasible solutions, checking their answer against problem requirements and using alternative methods to verify answers where possible.

### PARTICIPATION AND ACHIEVEMENTS

**PEER COACH TRAINING**<br>
Math peer coaching is a collaborative learning approach where students work together to enhance their understanding of mathematical concepts. This method involves more experienced or knowledgeable students assisting their peers in tackling challenging problems, clarifying doubts, and developing effective study strategies. Peer coaching in math is useful because it fosters a supportive learning environment, encourages active engagement, and builds confidence among students. By explaining concepts to others, peer coaches reinforce their own understanding, while learners benefit from personalized guidance and diverse perspectives, ultimately leading to improved academic performance and a stronger grasp of mathematical principles.

##### ELEMENTS OF BUSINESS SKILLS
Students were immersed in a world of hospitality excellence at JW Marriot Hotel as they toured the hotel’s luxurious amenities. The staff warmly welcomed the teachers and students, providing them with first hand insights about customer service and hotel operations. This experience enabled students to broaden their understanding of business management and relate their learning to real life. This year, we brought the students for Duck Tour (tourist attraction) &amp; a trip to Suntec City to look at the different retail &amp; F&amp;B outlets to further enhance their learning experience.
