### Department Introduction    

The (MA)3 Mathematics Framework focuses on developing three key student competencies namely Memory, Mastery and Modelling. Students’ needs in each tier are addressed through various programmes and practices to optimise their learning. We have planned activities with customised learning approaches that are more student-centred to spark the Joy of Learning. There is more emphasis on thinking and metacognition although mastery learning remains an integral part of the program. The development of 21st century skills is purposefully integrated into programmes.   
  
Apart from competencies students must also have the right attitudes to continually adapt and grow in a world that is rapidly evolving and highly connected. Hence we emphasise three desired student attitudes in problem solving in Yuhua namely Active, Articulate and Accurate in the learning of Mathematics in Yuhua.
