**DESIRED STUDENT OUTCOMES**<br>
ACTIVE:<br>Students can work effectively independently and collaboratively to identify problems and seek out possible solutions.

ARTICULATE:<br>Students can present their solutions in a logical manner, stating reasons where necessary in written and verbal form.

ACCURATE:<br>Students can derive correct and feasible solutions, checking their answer against problem requirements and using alternative methods to verify answers where possible.

### Home-based Learning

Home-based learning has become a vital learning platform for continual learning during the circuit breaker period. Teachers collaborated with each other to create more online learning resources and share them with colleagues to further enhance the effectiveness of home-based learning.

To encourage self-directed learning, the Mathematics department uploaded lesson materials for their classes in Student Learning Space (SLS). Assignments were marked and feedback given regularly for every assignment to ensure the continuity of studentsâ€™ learning progress.

The Covid-19 pandemic has, in fact, created an opportunity for teachers to look at all the possibilities of learning experiences and platforms for our students by using ICT-enabled affordances in the future.
