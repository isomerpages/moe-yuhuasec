# **Mathematics**

### Our Team

### Department Introduction    

The (MA)3 Mathematics Framework focuses on developing three key student competencies namely Memory, Mastery and Modelling. Students’ needs in each tier are addressed through various programmes and practices to optimise their learning. We have planned activities with customised learning approaches that are more student-centred to spark the Joy of Learning. There is more emphasis on thinking and metacognition although mastery learning remains an integral part of the program. The development of 21st century skills is purposefully integrated into programmes.   
  
Apart from competencies students must also have the right attitudes to continually adapt and grow in a world that is rapidly evolving and highly connected. Hence we emphasise three desired student attitudes in problem solving in Yuhua namely Active, Articulate and Accurate in the learning of Mathematics in Yuhua.

### Signature Programme(s)

**Joy of Learning Mathematics**

**1\. Y-Venture**

Y-Venture aims to excite the Joy of Learning Mathematics through gamifications and experiential learning.

During the learning activity, students work in small groups to solve a series of math-related problems which would then lead to more clues or number codes required to open the combination locks before they can escape from different rooms and finally be set free.

Y-Venture challenges students to reason, communicate and apply metacognitive skills that they have learnt in their Math class. Our escape rooms provides students great enjoyment in learning mathematics and at the same time, inculcates the values of resilience, perseverance and cooperation to complete the mission.

**2. Experiential Learning Activities**  

The Mathematics department provides opportunities for all students to enjoy learning through fun activities. Some of these activities go beyond the classroom environment such as learning journeys and classroom experiential learning activities.

Lower secondary students visited the Science Centre and enjoyed the Mass Escape Game and DinoQuest.

Upper secondary students were engaged in playing Math board games called Jungle Stumble in school. Students got very excited as the game was based not only on mathematical skills and understanding, but also pure luck! Therefore, anyone could win it. 

Our teachers strive to provide a highly engaging environment during lesson enactment. We believe experiential learning would provide greater joy in the learning of Mathematics. For example, the teaching of the concept of factorisation and trigonometry can be made more fun & enjoyable through concrete visualisations and measurement. Watch the two videos below on how the joy of learning math is made alive!

**3\. EBS iExperience programme**

Through the 2D1N EBS iExperience programme, students are immersed in various aspects of business and services so that they can find greater meaning in what they have learned. The activities for the learning journey will be based on lessons that have already been covered in the classroom. The information collected during the learning journey will be used for the mini‐coursework.

### Talent Development Programme

The Mathematics Department Talent Development Programme enables students with strong interest and talent in Mathematics to challenge themselves by participating in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiads (SMO) and All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competitions.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the trainings were carried out online. The selected students demonstrated responsibility and resilience as they practiced on their own following and sought feedback from their teachers through virtual meetings.

### Academic Support Programmes

**1\. iBelieve and Booster Programmes**  
The iBelieve and Booster Programmes are targeted for selected lower secondary students. These after-school programmes aim to strengthen our students’ foundation in Mathematics and increase their level of confidence.  
  
So, what’s the feedback from the students? All of them agreed that they were happy and enjoying themselves as their teachers create positive learning environment during these afternoon activity lessons.

**2\. iSTRIVE Programme**

The iStrive programme supports students who have good achievements in Math at lower secondary and are offered Math in a more challenging stream as they progress to the next level.

The programme starts during the first few weeks of the November school holiday to cover topics in another stream so that these students are able to start the following year on an equal footing as their other peers.

To ensure adequate support in terms of their subject learning and emotional well-being, consultations will be held fortnightly throughout the students’ first year in a new stream.
