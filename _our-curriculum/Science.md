<p>The Science Department comprises a dedicated team of teachers and STEM
instructors committed to nurturing curious, confident, and future-ready
learners. Through meaningful learning experiences, authentic inquiry, and
strong collaboration across disciplines, we inspire students to explore,
question, and appreciate the world of Science.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>
<p>A collaborative Science team that inspires curiosity and empowers every
learner to explore, question, and grow as a confident, lifelong inquirer.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
<p>We collaborate to design meaningful Science learning experiences that
spark curiosity, nurture e21CCs, and empower students to think critically
and inquire confidently about the world around them.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Signature Programme(s)</strong></h4>
<p>Our programmes weave research-driven innovation, curriculum alignment,
and purposeful use of school platforms to deepen inquiry and strengthen
students' STEM confidence.</p>
<p><strong>1. STEM and Design Thinking in Science Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>We integrate Design Thinking into Science lessons and Applied Learning
Programme (ALP) experiences to help students understand how scientific
knowledge contributes to real-world solutions.</p>
<p>Using plastic pollution as a schoolwide Contemporary Issues (CI) theme,
students first examined the environmental impact of plastics to build empathy
and awareness. They then engaged with STEM Learning Corners in the library,
where authentic materials and curated activities guided them to define
key challenges and ideate alternatives.</p>
<p>Students who wished to extend their learning joined workshops to prototype
water pods, exploring spherification and testing how changes in material
concentration influenced membrane strength and texture. This process gave
students a hands-on<strong> </strong>experience of how scientists study
sustainable alternatives to plastics, showing them that they too can contribute
to change.</p>

<p><strong>2. Inquiry-Rich and Hands-on Science Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>Students take part in hands-on investigations that help them make sense
of scientific concepts through real-world applications.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Separation Techniques: Coke vs. Coke Zero</strong>
<br>Students applied scientific methods to verify sugar content in beverages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turmeric Natural Indicator<br></strong>Students explored acids,
bases, and pH levels using a natural colour-changing indicator.</p>

<p><strong>3. Contemporary Issues (CI) Sharing: Connecting Science to the Real World</strong>
</p>
<p>CI Sharing is a schoolwide platform where students explore current Science-related
issues and connect them to classroom concepts.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<p><strong>“The Unofficial Guide to Being Human” Exhibit</strong>
</p>
<p>Students examined the science behind screen time—how it affects learning,
vision, and focus—linking their observations to concepts learned in Science
lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Plastic Pollution</strong>
</p>
<p>Students explored how plastics impact communities and ecosystems, laying
the foundation for later Design Thinking activities and water pod prototyping.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Oil Spill in June 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learned about the incident and the strategies used locally to
manage it, which led to an extended workshop where they experimented with
different clean-up methods. Using droppers, spoons, straws, and cotton
wool, students compared approaches, discussed their strengths and limitations,
and observed a teacher demonstration of hair as an effective oil absorber.</p>

<p><strong>4. Collaboration and Partnerships</strong>
</p>
<p>Collaboration within the department strengthens instructional practice.
Teachers co-design lessons, share expertise, and support one another in
enhancing inquiry-based learning.</p>
<p>Partnerships with parents further enrich students’ experiences.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Parent–Child STEM Workshop: Bioplastics<br></strong>Families explored
biodegradable materials together, applying scientific thinking to sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>5. STEM Learning Stations</strong>
</p>
<p>STEM stations placed around the school provide open, low-barrier entry
points for students to explore concepts beyond the classroom. These stations
foster curiosity, agency, and independent learning.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Science Competitions</strong></h4>
<p>To stretch students with strong interest and aptitude, the department
sends participants to national and international competitions such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Australian Big Science Competition</strong>
</p>
