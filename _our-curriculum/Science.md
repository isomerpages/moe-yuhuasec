<p>The Science Department comprises a dedicated team of teachers and STEM
instructors committed to nurturing curious, confident, and future-ready
learners. Through meaningful learning experiences, authentic inquiry, and
strong collaboration across disciplines, we inspire students to explore,
question, and appreciate the world of Science.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Our Vision</strong></h4>
<p>A collaborative Science team that inspires curiosity and empowers every
learner to explore, question, and grow as a confident, lifelong inquirer.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Mission</strong></h4>
<p>We collaborate to design meaningful Science learning experiences that
spark curiosity, nurture e21CCs, and empower students to think critically
and inquire confidently about the world around them.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Signature Programme(s)</strong></h4>
<p>Our programmes weave research-driven innovation, curriculum alignment,
and purposeful use of school platforms to deepen inquiry and strengthen
students' STEM confidence.</p>
<p><strong>1. STEM and Design Thinking in Science Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>We integrate Design Thinking into Science lessons and Applied Learning
Programme (ALP) experiences to help students understand how scientific
knowledge contributes to real-world solutions.</p>
<p>Using plastic pollution as a schoolwide Contemporary Issues (CI) theme,
students first examined the environmental impact of plastics to build empathy
and awareness. They then engaged with STEM Learning Corners in the library,
where authentic materials and curated activities guided them to define
key challenges and ideate alternatives.</p>
<p>Students who wished to extend their learning joined workshops to prototype
water pods, exploring spherification and testing how changes in material
concentration influenced membrane strength and texture. This process gave
students a hands-on<strong> </strong>experience of how scientists study
sustainable alternatives to plastics, showing them that they too can contribute
to change.</p>

<p><strong>2. Inquiry-Rich and Hands-on Science Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>Students take part in hands-on investigations that help them make sense
of scientific concepts through real-world applications.</p>
