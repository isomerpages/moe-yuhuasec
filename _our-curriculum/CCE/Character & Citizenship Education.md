<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic
development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. Guided
by MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame and our school values - Curiosity, Adaptability,
Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Above All, CARE³, our CCE programme
is designed to equip students with social-emotional competencies and prepare
them to be future ready and active citizens of good character.</p>
<p>At YHSS, CCE is enacted with intentionality through several learning platforms.
These include CCE Lessons during curriculum time, Key Student Development
Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable
moments during other subject lessons, and learning opportunities beyond
school.</p>
<p>We adopt a whole school approach to ensure that CCE is delivered in a
student-centric and meaningful way. Embracing the belief that ‘Every Teacher
a CCE Teacher’ and ‘Every School Experience is a CCE Lesson’, we strive
to create a caring and enabling school environment that encourages authentic
and collaborative learning.</p>
