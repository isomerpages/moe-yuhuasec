<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) empowers students to develop a sense
of purpose in life, aligning with our school's vision of 'A Community Where
Learners Flourish'. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for
lifelong learning, ECG cultivates in students a growth mindset, adaptability,
and resilienceâ€”essential qualities for 'Braving the Future'. This approach
enables our Yuhuans to embrace future opportunities, appreciate the value
of all occupations, and embody the courage to care, connect, and contribute
to an ever-changing world.</p>

<p><strong>Flourish Week (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>Flourish Week (ECG), a signature school programme, is tailored to prepare
graduating Yuhuans for their post-secondary education journey, embodying
our theme of 'Braving the Future'.</p>
<p>This comprehensive initiative encompasses a variety of activities designed
to equip students with the courage to care, connect, and contribute beyond
their time at Yuhua Secondary. Industry talks by practitioners provide
valuable insights into diverse career fields, whilst alumni panel dialogues
offer practical tips on national exam preparation and the transition to
life after secondary school. Yuhuans engage in workshops to develop future-ready
skills, including mock interviews, personal statement crafting, and portfolio
development. These experiences not only empower our students but also cultivate
their resilience against the challenges of change and uncertainty.</p>
<p>Through the Flourish Week (ECG), ApLM@Schools and other ECG programmes,
Yuhuans are better prepared to thrive amidst the opportunities and challenges
in their post-secondary education journey, truly expressing our vision
of 'A Community Where Learners Flourish'.</p>
