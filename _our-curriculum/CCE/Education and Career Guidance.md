<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) empowers students to develop a sense
of purpose in life, aligning with our school's vision of 'A Community Where
Learners Flourish'. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for
lifelong learning, ECG cultivates in students a growth mindset, adaptability,
and resilienceâ€”essential qualities for 'Braving the Future'. This approach
enables our Yuhuans to embrace future opportunities, appreciate the value
of all occupations, and embody the courage to care, connect, and contribute
to an ever-changing world.</p>
