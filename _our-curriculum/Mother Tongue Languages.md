<p>In 2022, our school signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Jiangnan
New City Experimental Middle School in Wuxi, China. This MOU commits us
to a close partnership in three key areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Establishing exchange programmes for students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing a wide spectrum of exchange activities for school leaders and
teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborating on the teaching and learning of specific subject areas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A virtual exchange between our Chinese Language students and their counterparts
at Jiangnan New City Experimental Middle School took place in May 2023.
Though conducted online, this exchange enhanced the students' understanding
of each other's geographical environment, historical culture, and social
customs.</p>
<p>The actual travel exchange took place from May 28 to June 1, 2024. This
trip offered our Secondary Three students a wonderful opportunity to gain
valuable cultural experiences and broaden their global perspectives. In
addition to visiting our Twinning School, Jiangnan New City Experimental
Middle School and learning alongside its students, our students explored
various historical and cultural sites in Wuxi and Shanghai. We believe
this trip was not only educational but also a memorable and enriching experience
for the students.</p>
