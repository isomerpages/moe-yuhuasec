### Department Introduction

Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department aims to nurture our students to be keen learners, competent users of their mother tongue languages as well as individual who are morally upright.

The department expose students to the beauty and moral values of their MTL through classroom teaching and enrichment programmes, which allow our students to use their MTL as a living language effectively beyond the classroom settings. To further enthuse students in learning and using their MTL as well as to inculcate values, platforms and opportunities such as MTL Fortnight, language camps and participation in cluster/ zonal/ national competitions or activities will be provided to encourage students to use their MTL and appreciate the culture and values associated with it.

### Signature Programme(s)

**Conversational Chinese/Malay Programme**  

The aims of the Conversational Chinese Language (CL)/Malay Language (ML) programme are:&nbsp;

1.  To strengthen Singapore’s multiracial compact and engender multiculturalism through an active and inclusive approach
2.  To develop in students keener interest in one another’s culture from a young age
3.  To enable students to have some grounding of functional CL/ML so that they could more easily pick up the language should they need it for economic or other reasons in adult life.

Under this programme, the department aims to provide a variety of learning experiences such for students to build a basic understanding of the language and the associated culture.&nbsp;

Upon completion of the programme, students should be able to:

1.  Communicate in their non-mother tongue language in everyday situations using simple phrases and sentences
2.  Develop cross-cultural appreciation and build stronger cross-ethnic relationships

Every year, the Malay Language Centre of Singapore (MLCS) and the&nbsp;Academy of Singapore Teachers,&nbsp;organises the annual Malay Language Seminar. This year, Yuhua Secondary School’s &nbsp;Malay Language Unit was honoured to be selected to share their PLT findings at the 2022 Malay Language&nbsp;Seminar.

The theme of year’s seminar is&nbsp;The Arif Budiman Vision: Weaving the Excellence of Teaching and Learning of Malay Language and Culture in the Universe of Life (_Visi Arif Budiman: Menyulam Kecemerlangan PdP Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Melayu di Tengah Angkasaraya Kehidupan)._

The objectives of the seminar are as follows:

a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance teachers’ knowledge to plan and carry out effective Malay language teaching and learning;  

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance teachers’ professional development in conducting school-based research; and

c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide platform for teachers to share their research findings and best practices.

Mr Muhammad Shukri and Mdm Noorlinda Abdullah who were the school presenters, confidently shared on the application of CSI Planning method as well as ABC Dialogue in strengthening student narrative writing. The ML unit’s research has the objective of strengthening students' understanding of question and writing abilities in the 2 main domains of writing namely – effective planning and dialogue.

CSI planning and ABC Dialogue are applied to help students establish their clarity of thoughts in planning before starting the process of writing a narrative essay. This process can help increase students’ confidence in writing narrative essays. Embroidering the theory of Locus of Control in this process allows students to apply certain parts in improving the quality of their writing. This technique is expected to strengthen students' writing and help them master the 2 main domains of writing.

Participants who attended our presentation were impressed and gave positive feedback on the effectiveness of the writing method. The Malay Language unit is definitely looking forward to present their upcoming teaching and learning practices in future Malay Language Seminar.
