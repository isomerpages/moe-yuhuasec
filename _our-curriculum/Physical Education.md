### Department Introduction

The Physical Education (PE) Department seeks to equip Yuhuans with the knowledge, skills and mind-set to lead a healthy and active lifestyle. Apart from the weekly PE lessons, programmes like the Annual Cross Country Run, Sports Education Programme, Secondary 3 Adventure Camp and Sports Carnival create opportunities for all Yuhuans to enjoy and participate in physical activities.&nbsp;  

### Signature Programme(s)

**Annual Cross Country Run – The Principal’s Challenge**

Participants (students and staff) take part in a 2.4km run in Jurong Central Park.&nbsp; Students whose running time is faster than the Principal are recognised for their effort.

**Sports Education Programme (SEP)**

This programme for the lower secondary students enables them to experience sports like bowling and archery that are not taught during PE lessons. It aims to arouse students’ interest in continual sports participation, especially during their leisure time.

**Annual Secondary 3 Adventure Camp**&nbsp;

The programme is to provide students with an opportunity to participate in adventurous outdoor activities (e.g. rock wall climbing, water rafting, zip line, forest trek) and apply school values in an authentic outdoor setting.
