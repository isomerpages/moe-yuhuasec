<p>Yuhua Secondary School Parent Support Group (PSG)&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It takes a village to raise a child” – so a common saying goes. Since
2000, the members of Yuhua Secondary School Parent Support Group have been
supporting one another, the teachers, and the school leaders, in creating
and maintaining a safe and nurturing environment where Yuhuans, our “children”,
can flourish as curious and adaptable learners who care for themselves,
for others and for the community.</p>
<p>There is strong friendship among the members – we are proud that many
of us are still actively contributing and participating in events like
parenting programmes (talks from the school counsellor, Triple P seminars),
parent-child bonding activities (visit to Kok Fah Technology Farm, Parent-Child
Bonding Challenge), and special events at the school (Teacher’s Day, Partners’
Appreciation Day), long after our children have graduated from the school.
New members will find warm welcome from existing members, and experience
great camaraderie and fabulous food when we have our year-end Family Day
celebration and other gatherings.</p>
<p>We keep close touch with the teachers and school leaders who update us
once a quarter on new initiatives and progress, who also listen patiently
and with an open mind on feedback and suggestions from the parents.</p>
<p>Join us, for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get the latest on school activities and programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get support from other parents as you support your child in his/her learning
and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get opportunities to learn new skills and knowledge through the various
parenting programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get close to your child(ren) through the tips gained from parenting sessions,
plus the various school and PSG activities that you can participate in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to you being part of our Yuhua family.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
