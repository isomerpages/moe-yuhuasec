<h1>Principal's Message</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear Parents, Students and Visitors of Yuhua Secondary School</p>
<p>A Happy 2026 to you!</p>
<p>I am Mr Tang Hsin Wei, and I’m privileged to be appointed the new principal
of Yuhua Secondary in December 2025. As an educator for over 20 years,
I have previously taught and guided students in 4 schools and worked in
MOE Headquarters. I look forward to getting to meet and interact with all
of you soon.</p>
<p>Yuhua’s mission is to nurture students of character and purpose who <strong>Care</strong>, <strong>Connect</strong> and <strong>Contribute</strong>.
Through our school curriculum, <a href="https://www.yuhuasec.moe.edu.sg/our-ccas/Visual-Performing-Arts/concert-band/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CCAs</a> and
&nbsp;distinctive programmes of <a href="https://www.yuhuasec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/applied-learning-alp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Yuhua Changemakers</a> and
<a href="https://www.yuhuasec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/learning-for-life-llp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">M.E.L.O.D.Y</a>, Yuhuans will develop values of empathy and curiosity
to connect with issues they are passionate about, and apply their skills
and knowledge to contribute towards making a difference to their communities.</p>

<p>In recent years, our alumni <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yuhuass/posts/lee-kuan-yew-all-round-excellence-award-2023the-lky-are-is-a-national-level-awar/747894294013033/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kei Win</a>,

profiled by the media for their exemplary character and achievements. For
the 2<sup>nd</sup> consecutive year, the school’s cut-off point has improved,
reflecting an increasing preference among primary 6 parents and students
who indicated Yuhua in their secondary school choices. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My colleagues and I are committed to nurture Yuhuans to develop their
character and talents to flourish in school and in life. We also aim to
partner parents in a respectful and collaborative manner so that we can
work together to provide a caring and enabling environment for Yuhuans
to grow and learn.</p>
