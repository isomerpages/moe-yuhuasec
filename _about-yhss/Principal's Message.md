<h1>Principal's Message</h1>
<p>On behalf of the school, my warmest greetings to all in this new year!
I hope all Yuhuans hada wonderful break with your loved ones, all ready
to start school. To all our new Secondary One students and families: my
heartiest welcome!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I lead Yuhua Secondary School with a new rallying theme each year – to
unite all staff, students, and stakeholders with a common purpose. This
year, the rallying theme is especially close to my heart: <strong>‘Be The Change, From Inside Out’.</strong> There
are so many compelling reasons for this rallying theme, and I’ll outline
them below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, it is my fervent desire to build generations of Yuhuans who are
ready for the future. The future can be scary and challenging – and as
a school, we must always prepare our students to guard against the triple
evils of <strong>I-C-U</strong>:,</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Individualism and Instant Gratification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change and Uncertainty and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unhealthy Well Being Trends.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To do so, character comes first – and we must build resolute <strong>Above All, CARE3 values</strong> and
a strong moral compass in each and every Yuhuan, to <strong>Be The Change, From Inside Out.</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondly, to build Yuhuan Changemakers – we equip our students to <strong>Care, Connect and Contribute with a Design Thinking Mindset</strong>.
The future world needs not just problem solvers – but problem seekers.
‘Care, Connect, Contribute’ speaks of a Design Thinking mindset, where
every Yuhuan adopts empathy and curiosity to connect with issues they are
passionate about, applying all that they have learnt to contribute towards
change. Beginning from school, at home and into the larger society, our
hope is to build Yuhuans who truly live out what it means to <strong>Be The Change.</strong>
</p>
<p>Lastly, this rallying theme transfers agency, ownership and power to each
and every Yuhuan.&nbsp; We must <strong>believe in the ability and capacity of all Yuhuans to Be The Change.</strong> This
rallying theme calls on each and every one of us – in school, and as stakeholders
– to be entrusted with the power to make change within our own sphere of
control.</p>
<p>Put into context, this rallying theme is nothing new. In <strong>MOE’s Excellence in Action 2024</strong>,
the school had the opportunity to share our approach to build our signature
‘Care, Connect,Contribute’ with all school leaders and educators in Singapore.

Yuhua Changemakers.</p>
<p>As we head into 2025, I look forward to how Yuhuans role-model what it
means to <strong>Be The Change, From Inside Out.</strong> Do follow our Instagram<strong> </strong>(@yuhuasecondaryschool)
and Facebook (@yuhuass) as we share further highlights and<strong> </strong>achievements
of our Yuhuan community over the year.</p>
<p>I hope you are as excited as I am with 2025, and I look forward to your
continued support and partnership in your child / ward’s education journey
at Yuhua Secondary. Together, let’s Be The Change, From Inside Out!</p>
<p></p>
