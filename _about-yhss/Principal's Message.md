Principal's Message
===================

On behalf of the school, my warmest greetings to all! I hope all Yuhuans enjoyed a lovely break with your loved ones. To all our existing students and parents: we missed you during the holidays, and to our new students and parents: a warm welcome to our Yuhua family.<br>
The biggest thing that happened over the Dec 2022 break is likely the World Cup for many of us. It was an epic World Cup 2022, and I am sure many of us had a chance to capture some of the sporting excitement. It was a tournament with many upsets, as well as many inspiring success stories – whether for teams or individuals. In the same way, the journey through the last few years had been an epic one for us in schools. COVID has disrupted learning in many ways, but the school came together strongly over the years to build our vision of A Community Where Learners Flourish. Learning continued despite all challenges, and it is our mission as a team to Care, Connect and Contribute. We are heartened that our vision and mission resonates strongly with students, staff, parents and the wider community, and it is my wish that we work strongly as one team to continue celebrating the successes of our many Yuhuans.<br>

We are proud of the many inspirational successes by our own Yuhuans, and I encourage all parents to follow our website, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yuhuass/) (@yuhuass) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yuhuasecondaryschool/?hl=en) (@yuhuasecondaryschool) sites closely, as we leverage technology to connect all of us and be updated as a community.

In 2023, we look forward to many more possibilities and opportunities to flourish. I wish to rally the school to build on the foundations we’ve achieved, to move each individual and the school as an overall community&nbsp; <b> From Good To Great</b>. This is our rallying theme as Team Yuhua for 2023, as we seek to have &nbsp;<b>One Heart, One Mind and work as One Team</b> towards a community of flourishing learners who care, connect and contribute.
<br>To this end, our dedicated team of staff will work wholeheartedly with all students, parents and the greater community to boldly live out our values in nurturing a flourishing Yuhua from Good to Great. Whether it is during curriculum lessons, CCAs, Home-Based Learning Days, or in any other learning opportunity – we endeavour to seed in all Yuhuans strong positive motivation (One Heart), a growth mindset (One Mind) and a heart for others (One Team). Our ultimate goal is to seed the right values of &nbsp;<b>CARE<sup>3</sup></b>&nbsp; that will ensure that Yuhuans graduate with excellence and have the right character to contribute well to others in society.
<br>I hope you are as excited as I am with 2023, and I look forward to your continued support and partnership in your child / ward’s education journey at Yuhua Secondary. As we look ahead to the new academic year, the following are highlighted for your information:

Let’s&nbsp;<b>Dare to CARE<sup>3</sup></b>&nbsp;together, as we build a community where learners flourish!

Principal, Yuhua Secondary School
