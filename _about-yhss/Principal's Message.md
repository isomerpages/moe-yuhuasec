Principal's Message
===================

On behalf of the school, I would like to wish everyone a happy and meaningful 2022! The last two years were challenging years for students all over the world – I am proud that as one Yuhua, we have done well to bravely ride through the pandemic. Not only have we kept going and learning, we have many highlights amongst our Yuhuan students and staff to celebrate and cherish. Do follow our website, Facebook (@yuhuass) and Instagram (@yuhuasecondaryschool) sites closely, as we leverage technology to connect all of us and be updated as a community.

The school came together strongly over the last 2 years, as we have a clear and bold vision to build **A Community Where Learners Flourish**. Learning continues despite all challenges, for it is our DNA as one community towards our mission to **Care, Connect and Contribute**. We are heartened that our vision and mission resonates strongly with students, staff, parents and the wider community. Indeed, we welcome a bumper cohort joining us at Sec One next year, with a full enrolment across all streams for every of the 8 new classes in 2022.

This resonance gives us great confidence and conviction to continue in building strong foundations, as we strengthen existing structures to help our students deepen their joy for learning through positive education, as well as continue in building a positive culture that encourages strong relationships between students and teachers.

At the heart of it all, our school believes that every Yuhuan can flourish – as long as each and every Yuhuan cherishes the importance of our school values of **C**uriosity, **A**daptability, **Re**spect, **Re**sponsibility, **Re**silience and <b>Above All, CARE<sup>3</sup></b>. The pandemic has taught us many lessons, including the importance of developing self-motivated individuals who **care** not just about themselves, but are passionate to **connect** with others and issues, and with confidence, actively **contribute** to the good of others and society. This is only possible if we build each and every Yuhuan with a values-based education and with a strong <b>Dare to CARE<sup>3</sup>.</b>

<b>Dare to CARE<sup>3</sup></b> is our rallying theme as a school in 2022. To this end, our dedicated team of staff will work wholeheartedly with all students, parents and the greater community to boldly live out our values in nurturing a flourishing Yuhua. Whether it is during curriculum lessons, CCAs, Home-Based Learning Days, or in any other learning opportunity – we endeavour to help our students dig deeper to flourish by living out our values. Our primary goal to seed the right values of <b>CARE<sup>3</sup></b> will ensure that Yuhuans graduate with the right character to succeed in the future workplace and society.

I hope you are as excited as I am with 2022, and I look forward to your continued support and partnership in your child / ward’s education journey at Yuhua Secondary.

Let’s <b>Dare to CARE<sup>3</sup></b> together, as we build a community where learners flourish!

Mr Kevin Pang    
Principal, Yuhua Secondary School
