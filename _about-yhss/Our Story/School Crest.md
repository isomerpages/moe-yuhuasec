The bold circular brush stroke depicts the Yuhuan as having a continuous drive to pursue learning and growth.

The alphabet letter ‘Y’ incorporates an open book and a glowing flame. The torch symbolizes the school’s vision of education, in lighting up the student’s desire and quest for learning, and to flourish as a result. The open book, with red and green colours, represents the merger of Shuqun and Yuhua Secondary Schools.

The diagonal strokes on the right represent the latitude and the longitude of the Earth, reflecting the desire for Yuhuans to adopt a global outlook and perspective.
