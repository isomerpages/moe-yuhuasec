### School Song Lyrics

Here I am in Yuhua,  
a brand new day,   
ready for the challenges ahead.   
With care, I chart my destiny   
with the Yuhua family.    
With care, I'll learn and grow   
with the Yuhua family.

  

This is where I will flourish,  
here I'll find my voice and roar.  
This is where I accomplish,   
above all, CARE.

  

Here we are in Yuhua,  
a brand new day,   
ready for the diffâ€™rence we can make.    
We care, connect and contribute    
with the Yuhua family.    
With care, we'll learn and grow    
with the Yuhua Family

  

This is where we will flourish,    
here in one voice we will roar.   
This is where we accomplish,   
above all, CARE,   
above all, CARE.
